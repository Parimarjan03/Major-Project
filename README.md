All About the Project------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An automatic answer checker application that checks and marks written answers similar to a human being. This software application is built to check subjective answers in an online examination and allocate marks to the user after verifying the answer. The system requires you to store the original answer for the system. This facility is provided to the admin. The admin may insert questions and respective subjective answers in the system.

Once the user enters his/her answers the system then compares this answer to original answer written in database and allocates marks accordingly. The system consists of in built artificial intelligence sensors that verify answers and allocate marks accordingly as good as a human being.

However, this automated evaluation technique is only for the objective exams and not for the subjective ones. Subjective answer sheet checking is one of the huge administrative tasks for any education institute.

The accuracy and speed with which a computer can generate results , it is something which a human would take hours to do. The proposed system would also produce unbiased results which would further make everything more transparent

User Registration/ Login: User taking the test must first create an account in the system by registering themselves and then can login into the account to take test.

Admin Login: Admin would be having a login account. He can add questions in the system and their respective answers. The answers are stored as a base for reference for AI to use while checking answers.

Answer checking: The system checks the answer by matching the keywords in original and users answer. The other factors are the number of sentences or points that user has written.

Answer marks allocation: The marking criteria is decided by the admin and stored in the system for reference. AI uses these references and allots respective marks to the user.

Question answer addition: Admin can add questions from the system by the Exel Sheet.
